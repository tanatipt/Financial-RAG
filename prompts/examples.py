News Article Title:  Bitcoin DeFi booms as Core blockchain hits $260M in dual-staked assets 
News Article Body: Core, a proof-of-stake blockchain built on Bitcoin, has surpassed $260 million in dual-staked assets as institutional interest in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow.
Core’s initial contributor, Rich Rines, told Cointelegraph that as of April 7, over 44 million Core tokens have been dual-staked with 3,140 BitcoinBTCUSD. At the time of writing, the assets are worth about $260 million.
Core’s dual-staking model lets Bitcoin holders earn higher yields with CORE tokens. While users can stake BTC at a lower rate, those who stake BTC with Core tokens get an enhanced yield.
“Dual Staking can multiply base staking rewards over 15 times, depending on how many CORE tokens are staked,” Core said in a statement.
Core’s new milestone highlights growing demand for Bitcoin staking
The latest milestone was driven in part by institutional investors integrating Core’s staking model into their platforms.
Core Foundation said that major custodians like BitGo, Copper and Hex Trust have enabled their clients to gain access to the protocol by integrating dual staking. Core added that it had partnered with Maple Finance for a structured asset that uses Core’s dual-staking to generate yield.
Rines told Cointelegraph that institutions have been crucial catalysts to the early success of its dual staking model. He said the model unlocks new opportunities for institutions.
“This shift has broader implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, institutional BTC holdings required paying custody fees without generating yield,” Rines told Cointelegraph.
He added that by integrating Core’s staking model, institutions can turn Bitcoin into a yield-bearing asset that offsets costs and unlocks new capital efficiencies.
At the time of writing, Core holds the biggest total value locked (TVL) among Bitcoin sidechains. Footprint analytics puts Core’s TVL above $400 million, with a market share of 28%.
Bitcoin becoming “productive”
The Core team said the increase in the number of dual-staked CORE tokens highlights how the product fulfills its design. Rines told Cointelegraph:
Rines emphasized that Core’s dual-staking system offers a sustainable utility for long-term Bitcoin holders without requiring them to relinquish custody.
“This is Bitcoin becoming productive, not by trusting third parties, but by participating in a system designed to reward real alignment and long-term engagement,” Rines said.

News Article Title: Bitwise CIO claims tariff tantrum likely bullish for bitcoin as a ‘more fractured reserve system’ forms
News Article Body: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies remained in flux while world superpowers launched tariffs against one another in a global trade war as U.S. President Donald Trump announced wide-ranging import duties last week — hurling panic on equities and crashing already subdued risk assets.
“It’s hard to be an investor at times like this. The market is volatile, and the news flow is constant,” wrote Matt Hougan, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer, in a Tuesday note to clients. The deluge of media headlines and divergent expert analysis has further shaken investor sentiment, but the White House’s game plan also became clearer this week, Hougan remarked.
Steve Miran, chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, published a speech on Monday focused on the dollar’s reserve currency role. Miran said this dynamic has weighed on the United States’ manufacturing workforce and “kept currency markets distorted.”
“The underlying message is clear: The dollar needs to go lower,” said Hougan. “So when it comes to the tariff push, the thing I’m most certain of is this: The Trump administration wants a significantly weaker dollar, even if it means sacrificing the dollar’s role as the world’s sole reserve currency.”
Bitcoin's reserve status to mature
The move has vast implications for bitcoin, according to Bitwise’s CIO.
Hougan foresees bitcoin strengthening as the dollar weakens in the near term. Since 2020, BTC has gained ground whenever the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) — which tracks the dollar’s value against a mix of six other leading fiat currencies — declined, Hougan remarked. “Dollar down equals bitcoin up. I expect this pattern will continue.”
The long-term view paints an even more bullish picture for bitcoin, Hougan said. Tariff-led rebalancing and global de-dollarization may cause economies to adopt new reserve currencies. Hougan opined that the world will increasingly look to “hard money” like BTC and gold amid a shift to a “more fractured reserve system.”
“In this context, the case for bitcoin is simple: When international dynamics are fraught and global currencies are in flux, where else can investors go for a scarce, global, digital store of value that sits outside the control of any government or entity?,” Hougan posited.
Bitcoin fell over 4% in 24 hours to trade under $77,000 as new tariffs from China staggered markets, according to The Block’s price page. Nevertheless, Bitwise predicts that one BTC will cost $200,000 by the end of 2025.

News Article Title:  Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal grows during trade war uncertainty 
News Article Body: The global trade war may be a silver lining for Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a safe-haven asset next to gold, thanks to its liquidity and accessibility advantages compared to precious metals.
Financial markets have been rattled since US President Donald Trump’s April 2 reciprocal import tariffs announcement, leading to record-breaking sell-offs for traditional stock markets and a BitcoinBTCUSDcorrection below $75,000.
While gold remains the dominant refuge for investors during geopolitical stress, analysts say Bitcoin’s digital nature and 24/7 liquidity are helping it attract renewed interest.
“You want to store value in something other than U.S. assets. But you don’t want to own other nations’ currencies/debt/assets because they’re even weaker and you expect they’ll debase it,” said Hunter Horsley, CEO of crypto asset manager Bitwise, in an April 9 post on X.
“You look around, and you see it: an asset that can’t be debased, is controlled by no country, and that you can take into your possession immediately. You wind up buying Bitcoin,” Horsely said.
Despite the growing optimism, gold will likely remain the dominant asset, especially in the near term, Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen crypto intelligence platform told Cointelegraph, adding:
China’s Finance Ministry on April 9 announced new tariffs of up to 84% on US imports, effective April 10, as a retaliatory measure against Trump’s policy. Analysts believe a resolution could reduce uncertainty and reignite appetite for risk assets like crypto.
China’s tariffs come as a retaliatory response to Trump’s tariff plan, which imposed a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, effective April 9.
Some industry analysts see Trump’s global tariff negotiations as mere “posturing” for the US to reach an agreement with China, a development that may end global trade uncertainty and see risk assets such as crypto recover.
China, Russia reportedly using Bitcoin for settlement
Some nations are already taking steps toward using crypto assets for settlement in global trade.
“China and Russia have reportedly begun settling some energy transactions in Bitcoin and other digital assets,” wrote Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, in an April 8 note. “These are early signs that Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset into a functional monetary tool.”
Sigel noted other examples, including Bolivia’s plans to import electricity using crypto and French utility firm EDF’s exploration of using surplus power to mine Bitcoin.
“These developments reflect a growing interest in neutral settlement rails, especially among economies looking to bypass the U.S. dollar,” he said.
Previous reports also indicated that Russia is using Bitcoin and stablecoin for international oil trade to circumvent global sanctions.
Bitcoin’s evolving “volatility profile” also points to BTC “gradually maturing from a risky asset to a safe-have asset,” wrote André Dragosch, macro analyst and European head of research at Bitwise.
While the tariff uncertainty will continue limiting risk appetite during the negotiations, positive developments could bring renewed investment into crypto markets.
“We’ll start to see the rotation toward the crypto markets in the coming period where there’s more calm and peace in the markets where investors start to buy the dip and understand that some things have been undervalued,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Consultancy, told Cointelegraph.

News Article Title: Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings at Risk, May Sell BTC to Meet Obligations
News Article Body: In a recent regulatory filing, business intelligence firm Strategy disclosed the potential risk of selling its massive Bitcoin holdings to meet debt obligations.
The company, which has been known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, may have to abandon its founder Michael Saylor’s longstanding “never sell BTC” pledge if market conditions persist.Strategy Faces Liquidity Issues
Strategy has accumulated 528,185 BTC, with an average purchase price of $67,458, totaling $40,119 billion in value as of the filing date, and touts itself as the largest BTC-treasury company. Its last Bitcoinacquisitionwas on March 30th. However, the significant drop in the cryptocurrency’s market price has created an unrealized loss of nearly $6 billion for the first quarter of 2025.
The Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) read,
“As bitcoin constitutes the vast bulk of assets on our balance sheet, if we are unable to secure equity or debt financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all, we may be required to sell bitcoin to satisfy our financial obligations, and we may be required to make such sales at prices below our cost basis or that are otherwise unfavorable.”
The NASDAQ-listed company highlighted the potential liquidity issues it faces due to a combination of its heavy reliance on the world’s largest cryptocurrency as its primary asset and a lack of sufficient cash flow from its software business. Strategy has accumulated over $8 billion in debt, including substantial annual interest payments and dividend obligations on its preferred stock.
These financial pressures could force the company to liquidate its BTC holdings at a loss should it fail to secure timely financing through equity or debt.
The filing also outlined the risks tied to its Bitcoin strategy. The volatility of the asset’s price has contributed to a significant unrealized loss in digital assets, which could further exacerbate its financial struggles if the market value of the token continues to decline.
Despite adopting new accounting standards that allow for the fair valuation of Bitcoin, the company faces ongoing challenges in balancing its massive digital asset portfolio with its financial obligations.Trump’s Tariff Impact on Crypto
Bitcoin dropped under $75,000 earlier this week but managed a slight recovery later in the day as President Trump’s new global tariffs came into play. Several top tokens experienced similar declines. The retreat of traders from major cryptos erased the gains made during Tuesday’s brief rally as Trump continued to press ahead with his aggressive changes to global trade.
Meanwhile, tariffs on Chinese imports wereraisedto 104%, and import taxes were also increased for over 60 other trade partners.

This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.```
<market_analysis_report>:
### Current and Forecasted Market Sentiment for Bitcoin

#### Current Sentiment Analysis
The current market sentiment for Bitcoin is **Negative**. This conclusion is drawn from several key factors highlighted in the news articles:

1. **Price Decline**: Bitcoin has recently experienced a price drop, trading under $75,000 and showing a decline of over 4% in a 24-hour period 
   due to escalating global trade tensions and new tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China. This has led to a broader sell-off in risk assets, 
   including cryptocurrencies, as investors flee to safer investments amid uncertainty [3].

2. **Investor Caution**: The articles indicate a general reluctance among investors to engage with riskier assets like cryptocurrencies due to 
   the volatility caused by geopolitical events. The Bitwise CIO noted that the market is volatile and investor sentiment is shaken, which 
   contributes to a bearish outlook [1].

3. **Liquidity Concerns**: The potential for significant Bitcoin holdings to be sold by companies like Strategy due to liquidity issues further 
   exacerbates the negative sentiment. The company may need to liquidate its Bitcoin assets at unfavorable prices to meet financial obligations, 
   which could increase selling pressure in the market [4].

4. **Market Reactions to Tariffs**: The imposition of tariffs has led to a correction in Bitcoin prices, reflecting a direct impact of macroeconomic 
   factors on the cryptocurrency market. Analysts suggest that while Bitcoin is gaining recognition as a safe-haven asset, the immediate effects of 
   trade wars are causing uncertainty and price volatility [2, 4].

#### Forecasted Sentiment
While the current sentiment is negative, there are indications of potential recovery in the future:
- **Long-term Bullish Outlook**: Some analysts, like the Bitwise CIO, predict that Bitcoin could benefit from a weakening U.S. dollar and the evolving 
  global economic landscape, which may lead to increased adoption as a reserve asset [1].
- **Growing Institutional Interest**: The rise of Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional interest in staking models, as 
  seen with Core’s dual-staking system, suggests that there is a foundational shift towards making Bitcoin a more productive asset. This could 
  lead to renewed interest and investment in the long term [0].

#### Conclusion
In summary, the overall market sentiment for Bitcoin is currently **Negative** due to recent price declines, investor caution amid geopolitical tensions, 
and potential liquidity issues faced by major holders. However, there are signs of a possible long-term recovery driven by institutional interest 
and macroeconomic shifts. The immediate outlook remains bearish, but the evolving landscape could provide opportunities for future growth."""

News Article Title: Alphabet, Nvidia invest in OpenAI co-founder Sutskever's SSI, source says
News Article Body: AlphabetGOOGand NvidiaNVDAhave joined prominent venture capital investors to back Safe Superintelligence (SSI), a startup co-founded by OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever that has quickly risen to become one of the most valuable artificial intelligence startups months after its launch, a source familiar with the matter said.
The funding illustrates renewed interest from the big tech and infrastructure providers in making strategic investments in the startups developing cutting-edge AI that requires massive amounts of computing power. Alphabet, which has its own AI models, earlier in the week announced a deal by its cloud computing arm to sell SSI access to tensor processing units (TPUs), its in-house AI chips.
SSI, which sources say was recently valued at $32 billion in a round led by Greenoaks, is one of the highest-profile startups working on AI model research, thanks to Sutskever's stellar track record in predicting the next big thing in AI development.
Like many of its competitors, it has a huge demand for chips.
Reuters could not determine the exact terms of Alphabet's and Nvidia's investment in SSI. Spokespeople for all three companies declined to comment.
The twin moves by Alphabet's corporate and cloud division with high-profile AI labs including SSI and Anthropic show the tech giant's evolving AI hardware strategy.
Google originally reserved TPUs for in-house use. The deal to sell SSI chips in significant quantities to support its frontier AI research exemplifies the company's ongoing strategy to expand sales to external customers, Darren Mowry, a managing director in charge of Google's partnerships with startups, said in an interview with Reuters this week.
"With these foundational model builders, the gravity is increasing dramatically over to us," he said.
AI developers have historically preferred Nvidia's graphics processing units, which hold more than 80% of the AI chips market.
But SSI is so far primarily using TPUs rather than GPUs for its AI research and development, two sources said.
Google offers both Nvidia GPUs and its own TPUs through its cloud service. Its own chips are intended to excel at specific AI tasks and are more efficient than general-purpose GPUs. These chips have been used to build large-scale AI models, such as AppleAAPLand Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor that has received billions of dollars of funding from Google and AmazonAMZN.
Google and Nvidia also face a challenger in Amazon, which is building its own competing processors called Trainium and Inferentia. Amazon has said as far back as 2023 that Anthropic would develop its technology on those chips. The tech giant announced in December that Anthropic would be the first customer to use a massive supercomputer powered by hundreds of thousands of its own chips.
In the meantime, Anthropic continues to use TPUs for its AI development and has not decreased spending on Google's chips, two sources said.
It is increasingly common for major cloud providers to invest heavily in AI startups that not only build foundational models but also serve as significant customers of their infrastructure. For instance, Amazon and Google have both invested in Anthropic, while MicrosoftMSFThas placed substantial bets on OpenAI. Nvidia has also backed OpenAI, as well as Elon Musk's xAI.

News Article Title: Why the Zacks Rank is More Important Than Ever 
News Article Body: Over the last few weeks, the stock market had seen the largest monthly decline since the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, the post-pandemic recovery would end up making the COVID-19 plunge one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to reap massive returns when the market rebounded.
The current economic scenario may be different but one thing that remains the same is that the trend of earnings estimate revisions will help investors navigate which stocks to invest in, which is what the Zacks Rank is predicated on.
To that point, following the Zacks Rank will allow investors to see which companies are navigating a tariff-induced economic slowdown effectively. While it's never wise to bet against the stock market’s long-term prospects, the jitters are understandable as the Trump administration has implemented the highest tariffs on imports in over a century. This will certainly have global economic ramifications, especially with some countries likely to counter with reciprocal tariffs of their own.
Still, the Zacks Rank can help, with it noteworthy that the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks have more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.9% per year since 1998.
Market Recalibration &Cape Ratio Concerns
With many analysts calling for a recalibration in the market, famed investor and billionaire Jeffrey Gundlach has pointed out that the Cape ratio on the S&P 500 had been near its second-highest level ever at 38X, suggesting stocks are still overvalued.
Also known as the Shiller P/E ratio, the Cape ratio is used to calculate the price of the stock market or individual stocks relative to their average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years, smoothing out fluctuations caused by economic cycles. Although the forward earnings multiple on the S&P 500 is at a reasonable 20.1X, the Cape ratio still stands at 33.1X compared to its historical average of 16.9X.
Notably, Gundlach has called for a 60% chance of a recession, stating that leverage investors may be at risk of bankruptcy amid large market swings while companies deal with tariff ramifications as opposed to supply chain issues during the pandemic.

Using The Mag 7 as an Example
There is no doubt that intriguing long-term buying opportunities are being presented, and many investors may be scoping out the Mag-7 stocks such as EV leader Tesla TSLA, AI chip leader Nvidia NVDA, and electronics giant Apple AAPL.
Apple for instance may be placed in a difficult spot for investors to consider whether it's time to buy on the dip with AAPL recently trading near its 52-week low of $164 a share before rebounding to just under $200. While Apple’s stock is still trading 23% from its 52-week high, the company will be significantly affected by tariffs as it relies heavily on international manufacturing in China, India, and Vietnam.
The Zacks Rank suggests it may be time to fade the recent rally in AAPL off its lows, as earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline over the last quarter and are down in the last week for fiscal 2025 and FY26. This has led to Apple’s stock landing a Zack Rank #4 (Sell).
It's noteworthy that Nvidia is the only Mag 7 stock that has a buy rating (Zacks Rank #2) at the moment as the chipmaker has seen a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, suggesting NVDA should be in store for a sharper rebound than its big tech peers. The trend of rising EPS estimates has continued over the last year with NVDA still up +25% during this period despite an 18% dip in 2025.
ASLE is an Intriguing Addition to the Zacks Rank #1 List
Trading under $10 a share, AerSale’s ASLE stock is an intriguing addition to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list. AerSale provides integrated, diversified aviation aftermarket products and services for aircraft owners and operators to realize savings in the operation, maintenance, and monetization of their aircraft, engines, and components. Notably, AerSale’s Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment Industry is currently in the top 9% of over 240 Zacks industries.
Benefiting from its strong business environment, EPS estimates have soared for AerSale over the last 60 days, with annual earnings now expected to skyrocket 261% this year to $0.65 per share compared to $0.18 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to increase another 20% to $0.78.

Bottom Line
With earnings estimate revisions seen as the most powerful force impacting stock prices, following the Zacks Rank will surely be beneficial amid heightened market volatility, as a historic trade war plays out.

News Article Title: China's $8.2 Billion AI Fund Aims to Undercut U.S. Chip Giants
News Article Body: China has unveiled an $8.2 billion artificial intelligence funding initiative aimed at strengthening its domestic AI ecosystem and reducing reliance on U.S. semiconductor firms like NvidiaNVDAand BroadcomAVGO.
The new state-backed AI Industry Investment Fund will prioritize early-stage projects while also targeting core parts of the AI supply chain, including computing infrastructure, algorithms, data resources, and applications. Robotics will also be a major area of focus.
A large portion of the funding is being drawn from the third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, widely known as the Big Fund. This fund was created to accelerate China's push toward chip self-sufficiency amid escalating trade friction and export controls on advanced Western technologies.
The move underscores Beijing's strategic approach to AI development, in contrast to the market-driven models seen in the U.S. According to TechInAsia, China surpassed the U.S. in global AI startup funding back in 2017 and is pursuing its goal of building a $150 billion AI industry by 2030, with projections that it could generate nearly half of the global AI-related economic value by then.
The rise of firms like DeepSeek and China's growing AI independence have served as a warning to U.S. tech leaders. Nvidia, Broadcom, and MicrosoftMSFTare all watching closely as China ramps up its state-backed ambitions.

News Article Title: US Stocks End Week on Higher Note, Tariff Worries Persist
News Article Body: US equities ended a volatile week on a higher note Friday as investors struggled to determine the likely impact of the growing trade war between the US and China on global economy.
The Nasdaq Composite rose 2% to 16,724.5 and the S&P 500 added 1.8% to 5,363.4. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.6% higher at 40,212.7, with all three major gauges rebounding from early declines as the dollar and bond yields steadied. All sectors advanced, led by materials and technology.
US Treasury yields closed higher, but some fell back from their intraday highs. The 10-year closed 9 basis points higher at 4.49%, off an earlier high around 5.59%, but the yield for two-year Treasuries increased 10 basis points to 3.95%.
China overnight raised its tariff on US goods to 125%, with the 41-basis-point increase to its prior rate slated, to begin this weekend in response President Donald Trump on Thursday boosting US import duties on Chinese goods to 145%.
There were signs tariff concerns are beginning to spill over into the broader US economy. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment fell to a preliminary April reading of 50.8, down from the final 57.0 print in March and almost doubling the drop to 53.5 reading experts in a Bloomberg survey expected.
A think tank tracking the automobile industry said on Friday a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico will likely add $41.9 billion in costs for the "Big 3" US automakers, namely General MotorsGM, Ford (F) and Stellantis (STLA).
GM, meanwhile, will temporarily halt operations at a plant in Ontario that makes electric vans although the shutdown is tied to slowing customer demand rather than tariffs, the company reportedly said. GM shares were fractionally lower in regular trading.
There was upbeat news on inflation, however. The US Producer Price Index fell 0.4% during March, compared with forecasts expecting a 0.2% increase. Excluding food and energy prices, core PPI slid 0.1%, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
In company news, JPMorgan ChaseJPM, Morgan StanleyMSand Wells FargoWFCall reported improved Q1 earnings, topping Wall Street estimates. Wells Fargo's revenue lagged the analyst consensus and the bank's stock closed 1% lower. JPMorgan was 4% higher and Morgan Stanley was over 1% up.
Texas InstrumentsTXNshares fell 5.8%, posting the steepest decline on the S&P 500, after Chinese officials said semiconductor companies with fabrication facilities in the US would be "liable for tariff rates of 84% or higher" but the state-backed China Semiconductor Industry Association exempted several chipmakers, including NvidiaNVDAand QualcommQCOMwho outsource their production.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2.3% higher at $61.50 per barrel. Gold futures rose 2.1% to $3,248.80 per ounce, and silver was up 4.5% up to $32.15.

News Article Title: US Equity Indexes Rise This Week as Trump Pauses Reciprocal Tariffs for 90 Days
News Article Body: US equity indexes rose this week, seemingly unaffected by plunging government bond prices and the dollar after President Donald Trump paused reciprocal import duties on all trading partners except China.
* The S&P 500 closed at 5,363.36 on Friday, versus 5,074.08 a week earlier. The Nasdaq Composite stood at 16,724.46 compared with 15,587.79 a week prior. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at 40,212.71 versus 38,314.86 a week ago. Wednesday's surge helped the three mainstream gauges post weekly gains.

Applied Digital Corporation Stock Price and EPS Surprise
Applied Digital Corporation price-eps-surprise | Applied Digital Corporation Quote
APLD earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing three quarters while beating the same once, with a negative average surprise of 185.39%.
Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.
Factors to Note for APLD Q3 Earnings
Applied Digital, builder and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure designed for High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications, cloud services, and data center hosting, has been benefiting from strong top-line growth. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.
The company is seeing strong demand in its Cloud Services business, driven by the deployment of additional GPU clusters. As more clusters go online and AI applications continue to expand, this segment is expected to have contributed significantly to APLD’s revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Cloud Services business revenues jumped 523% year over year to $27.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
APLD’s data center hosting segment for cryptocurrency clients remains strong, especially with Bitcoin recently hitting $100,000. The demand for hosting services, particularly in North Dakota, is likely to stay robust, providing a solid revenue stream in the fiscal third quarter of 2025. The Data Center Hosting business segment generated $36.2 million in revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
APLD’s newly announced partnership with Macquarie Asset Management is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. The $5 billion perpetual preferred equity financing facility, including the $900 million allocated for the Ellendale HPC campus, will provide financial support for future expansion, enabling further development of data center infrastructure.
Investments from CIM Group,NVIDIANVDA, and now Macquarie are helping to lower the cost of capital, which will aid in financing APLD’s ongoing and future projects. This support from prominent investors is likely to have improved the company’s financial flexibility and accelerated growth in the to-be-reported quarter.

News Article Title: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy? 
News Article Body: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have madeNVIDIA CorporationNVDA a Wall Street darling for some time. On the other hand,Broadcom Inc.’s AVGO recent share repurchase plan, along with its planned moves to capitalize on the growing AI field, has delighted income-oriented investors.
However, the latest trade war between the United States and several other countries has caused market turmoil, with shares of NVIDIA and Broadcom declining 19.9% and 25.7% year to date. This presents an opportunity to buy these quality stocks at a discounted price for long-term gains. But which stock is the better bargain? Let’s explore –
Reasons to be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock
NVIDIA leads the growing graphics processing unit (GPU) market with over 80% share, giving the Jensen Huang-led company a competitive edge over its peers. More thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform is in demand among developers.
At the same time, there is an insane demand for NVIDIA’s new Blackwell chips among notable tech firms due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces. The older Hopper chips also maintain steady demand due to their higher quality compared to rivalIntel Corporation’s INTC chips (read more: Can Intel Be the Turnaround Stock of 2025? Is the Time to Buy Now?).
NVIDIA, meanwhile, is well-poised to make the most of the increase in AI data center spending. Top cloud computing stocks are fulfilling the increase in demand for AI workloads by acquiring GPUs and are spending $250 billion on AI data center infrastructure. One of NVIDIA’s prominent customers,Microsoft CorporationMSFT, may have reduced data center spending, butAlphabet Inc.GOOGL andAmazon.com, Inc.AMZN are now supporting NVIDIA in this aspect.
Reasons to be Bullish on Broadcom Stock
Broadcom expects the demand for its custom AI accelerator to increase in the near future and the market size for its execution processing units (XPUs) to touch $60-90 billion by fiscal 2027, way higher than last year’s $12.2 billion.
Broadcom’s XPUs can work on a particular workload and even outdo NVIDIA’s GPUs. Moreover, they have the competence to perform tasks more affordably than GPUs. Thus, banking on the rise in demand for accelerator chips, Broadcom is now developing a 2-nanometer AI XPU, which is unique. The company’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), known to support AI and machine learning, are witnessing strong demand as well.
NVDA or AVGO: Which Stock is a Better Bargain Buy?
No doubt, with GPUs and XPUs gaining popularity in the coming years, and AI infrastructure spending increasing, the future does look bright for both NVIDIA and Broadcom. However, from a long-term perspective, NVIDIA is a better choice than Broadcom.
This is because NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently than Broadcom, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, more than AVGO’s 18.5%.
NVIDIA has also been able to control its expenditures and generate profits in a much better way than Broadcom since its return on equity (ROE) of 117.6% outshined AVGO’s 38.5%.
But from a short-term viewpoint, Broadcom has an upper hand over NVIDIA. After all, Broadcom is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a better-quality business that can keep the company immune to the current market vagaries.
Broadcom has increased its dividends 6 times over the past five years, and its payout ratio sits at a healthy 52% of earnings. Broadcom also has sufficient cash balance to pay off its dividends. Check Broadcom’s dividend history here.
On the contrary, NVIDIA’s payout ratio sits at a paltry 1% of earnings and the company increased dividends only once in the past five years. Check NVIDIA’s dividend history here.
NVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.

News Article Title: Trade War, Capex Pressures Push Citi to Lower Nvidia, Marvell Outlooks
News Article Body: Citi adjusted its outlook on NvidiaNVDAand Marvell TechnologyMRVLon Friday, citing rising concerns over tariffs and a cautious capital spending environment among large tech clients.
For Nvidia, analyst Atif Malik reduced projected GPU unit shipments for calendar years 2025 and 2026 by 3% and 5%, respectively. The revision reflects updated expectations for hyperscaler capital expenditures, which now forecast spending growth of 35% in 2025 and 15% in 2026 both lower due to reduced confidence in Microsoft'sMSFTspending and broader economic uncertainty linked to the ongoing trade war.
While Nvidia may be able to offset some of the added GPU costs through price increases, the firm expects profit margins to be affected. Malik lowered Nvidia's earnings projections by 3% for 2025 and 6% for 2026 and revised his price target to $150, while retaining a Buy rating.
For Marvell, Citi trimmed fiscal 2027 revenue and earnings forecasts by 5% and 8%, respectively. The cuts stem from lowered expectations for hyperscaler demand and revised assumptions around chip-on-a-wafer-substrate technology.
Malik also cut projected AI ASIC volumes for 2026 by 20%, citing the possibility that Amazon's Trainium line may not rely solely on Marvell as a supplier going forward. Despite these revisions, Citi reiterated a Buy rating on Marvell.

News Article Title: Citi Cuts Nvidia Price Target to $150 on Capex Concerns, Maintains Buy Rating
News Article Body: Citi analyst Atif Malik reduced his price target on Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) to $150 from $163, citing concerns over reduced capital expenditures by major cloud customers and broader uncertainty in enterprise spending.
In a note to clients, Malik said he now expects Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) shipments for calendar years 2025 and 2026 to decline by 3% and 5%, respectively. The adjustment reflects Citi's revised hyperscaler capital expenditure forecast, which assumes 35% growth in 2025 and 15% in 2026. The cut was attributed in part to anticipated lower investment by Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and a heightened risk that enterprises may delay technology purchases due to a weakening global macroeconomic backdrop, including pressures from an ongoing trade war.
Despite the downward revision in unit shipments, Malik said the impact on Nvidia's sales will be limited, as the company is expected to partially offset the effect through price inelasticity in its AI-focused GPU product lines. As a result, Citi lowered its earnings per share forecast for Nvidia by 3% in 2025 and 6% in 2026.
Citi's revised $150 target is based on a price-to-earnings multiple of 30 times its discounted 2026 EPS estimate, aligning with the stock's historical average over the past three to five years. The investment firm maintained its Buy rating, citing Nvidia's technology leadership in the AI hardware segment as a key support for long-term growth.

News Article Title: Nvidia, Marvell Face Fresh Cloud Investment Risks as Citi Cuts Outlook
News Article Body: April 11- NvidiaNVDAand Marvell TechnologyMRVLdrew investor attention Friday after CitiCrevised down its forecasts for both chipmakers, citing weakening enterprise demand and tariff uncertainty.
Citi analyst Atif Malik lowered Nvidia's 2025 and 2026 earnings projections by 3% and 6%, respectively, pointing to reduced cloud spending, particularly by MicrosoftMSFT, and the rising risk of slower investment due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. He also trimmed the firm's GPU unit forecasts by 3% for calendar year 2025 and 5% for 2026.
Malik noted Nvidia may try to offset higher GPU costs by raising prices, but cautioned this could compress margins. He cut his price target on the stock to $150 from $160 but maintained a Buy rating.
Marvell faced similar pressure. The bank lowered its fiscal 2027 revenue and profit outlooks by 5% and 8%, respectively, citing weaker-than-expected hyperscaler demand. Citi also slashed its AI chip estimates by 20%, noting that AmazonAMZNmay diversify ASIC suppliers for future Trainium products. Malik reiterated a Buy on the stock despite the cuts.

News Article Title: US chipmakers outsourcing manufacturing will escape China's tariffs
News Article Body: U.S. chipmakers that outsource manufacturing will be exempt from China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, according to a notice by the main Chinese semiconductor association on Friday.
Given the highly specialized and multi-country nature of chip supply chains, there was uncertainty within the industry about how tariffs would be applied to chip imports.
"For all integrated circuits, whether packaged or unpackaged, the declared country of origin for import customs purchases is the location of the wafer fabrication plant," the state-backed China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA), which represents the country's largest chip companies, said in an "urgent notice" on its WeChat account.
For U.S. chip designers such as Qualcomm and AMD that outsource manufacturing to Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC2330, Chinese customs authorities will classify these chips' place of origin as Taiwan, according to EETop, an information platform and forum for Chinese chipmakers.
This means China-based companies importing such chips will not be forced to pay China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, EETop said on its WeChat account.
"In contrast, chips made by... Intel, Texas Instruments, ADI, and ON Semiconductor - which operate their own U.S.-based fabs - may be classified as U.S. origin and be liable for tariff rates of 84% or higher," it added.
Shares of AMDAMDand AI chipmaker NvidiaNVDA- two major customers of TSMC - rose 6% and 2.6% respectively, while Qualcomm was up 1.1%.
IntelINTCmeanwhile fell more than 6%. The company is one of the largest producers of personal computer chips and the only American semiconductor firm gearing up to manufacture the most advanced processors in the United States.
Analog chipmaker Texas Instruments'TXNshares slumped more than 8% and rival Analog DevicesADIwas down 3.3%. Automotive chipmaker OnsemiONfell 3.4%.
Beijing on Friday increased its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125%, hitting back against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145%. EETop's analysis was published on Friday before Beijing's latest tariff hike.
CHINA CHIP INDUSTRY BENEFITS
After CSIA's clarification, the prospect of high tariffs on U.S.-origin chips led to a surge in Chinese chipmakers' shares on Friday.
"The notice from CSIA helps distinguish which U.S. chips will be hit with tariffs," said He Hui, semiconductor research director at tech research company Omdia, "It is clear that some chips made in the U.S. will still be taxed even if they are packaged in China."
He added that this could benefit China's domestic chipmaking and its supply chains as foreign semiconductor firms pursue a "China for China" strategy - manufacturing for the Chinese market in China.
Beijing has long poured subsidies into strengthening its domestic production of mature-node chips, often dubbed legacy semiconductors. These chips, built on older manufacturing techniques, compete with analog components made by firms such as Texas Instruments.
"China's exemption for outsourced U.S. chipmakers appears to be a calculated move to maintain economic stability and encourage foreign investment in local manufacturing," said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.
Globally, most mature-node semiconductor capacity is held by firms that both design and manufacture chips such as Texas Instruments. In China, such capacity is largely concentrated among contract manufacturers, according to a report last year by the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Bernstein analysts said the CSIA's move was a big surprise to the market as investors generally considered the location of packaging to be the country of origin, not the fab, and it was way more difficult to shift fabs.
It would make it harder for the likes of Intel and Texas Instruments to avoid Chinese tariffs, or at least some rejigging of manufacturing location and logistics. And potential beneficiaries could include their Japanese semiconductor rivals such as Renesas, they said.

News Article Title: The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Palantir Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Microsoft and Amazon.com
News Article Body: For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – April 11, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.
Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:
Can Palantir Outperform NVIDIA, and Should You Buy the Stock?
The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has made semiconductor behemothNVIDIA Corp.and data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies Inc.Wall Street darlings, with their shares witnessing massive gains. But this year, NVIDIA’s shares have fallen 15.1%, while Palantir’s shares have gained 21.5% amid Trump tariff woes. Does this mean Palantir has more growth potential and investment appeal? Let’s explore –
Reasons to Be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock
NVIDIA’s share of over 80% in the growing graphics processing unit (GPU) market gives the company a competitive edge over its peers. Among the developers, NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform is in more demand thanAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s ROCm software platform. The change is unlikely due to the complexity of infrastructure transitions.
There is insane demand for NVIDIA’s both new and older chips. The new-generation Blackwell chips with faster AI interfaces are popular among prominent tech firms. Meanwhile, the older Hopper chips maintained steady demand due to their superior quality.
AI data center spending is also rising, a boon for NVIDIA. Major cloud computing stocks are poised to invest nearly $250 billion in AI data center infrastructure, purchasing GPUs to meet the growing demand for AI workloads.
For now,Microsoft Corp., one of NVIDIA’s primary customers, has scaled back on some of the data center projects. However, competitorsAmazon.com, Inc.have stepped in to fill the gap for NVIDIA.
Reasons to Be Bullish on Palantir Stock
Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has been a grand success among existing and new customers owing to its capability to automate tasks beyond human capacity. AIP helps its clients decode complex information by applying generative AI in the decision-making workflows.
From International Data Corp. to Forrester Research, AIP’s prowess was praised by all. Palantir saw a 43% increase in customer count in the fourth quarter, thanks to AIP’s popularity. Its customer base expanded into the private sector beyond government clients, boosting revenue growth.
The company’s revenues rose 36% in the fourth quarter, with Palantir expecting revenues to increase 31% year over year in the current year. Moreover, the company’s remaining performance obligation in the fourth quarter surpassed current revenue growth, indicating strong upcoming growth.
Can Palantir Outpace NVIDIA? Should I Invest in PLTR Stock Now?
Dominance in the GPU market, persistent demand for chips, and an uptick in AI infrastructure spending should help the NVIDIA stock scale upward in the long term.
Lest we forget, the company has a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.85. Any reading below 1 signifies that the stock is undervalued and has the potential to rise when the market realizes its true worth. Maybe that’s why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 82.9% to $176.15 from the previous $96.30.
On the other hand, Palantir’s top customer, the government, is cutting spending due to uncertainty about future software budgets. The Trump administration has asked DOGE to trim its budget by 8% each year for the next five years, hampering Palantir’s growth.
To top it off, Palantir is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 165.49, which is quite expensive for a company whose earnings are projected to grow 37% in 2025. So, Palantir has set a high bar for itself, but the overvalued stock could crash if business objectives aren’t met. Therefore, it’s premature to expect Palantir stock to outperform NVIDIA soon.
Brokers are also skeptical about Palantir’s growth story as they have raised the stock’s average short-term price target by only 9.3% to $84.53 from the previous $77.32.
Given such uncertainty, new entrants should avoid investing in Palantir stock as of now. However, those who have invested may hold onto the stock since an increase in customer base on AIP acceptance is good news for Palantir.
Palantir currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), whereas NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.

NVIDIA
NVIDIA — the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) —reaffirmed its commitment to continued innovation, evolution and execution. After the successful execution of Hopper GPUs (with sales of more than 1.3 million units), NVDA’s existing Blackwell GPUs have already seen over 3.6 million units sold to cloud providers.
NVIDIA is expected to unveil Blackwell Ultra — in the second half of 2025 and begin shipping of Vera Rubin — in 2026. In addition, the company decided that it will announce its roadmap for Rubin Next — to be introduced in 2027 and Feynman AI chips in 2028.
The major innovation for NVDA’s new chipsets is a qualitative shift from pureplay generative AI models to reasoning AI models. NVIDIA said that AI chips with faster speed will be the best option for companies that opt for reasoning AI-based infrastructure to save costs and maximize returns. In this regard, its upcoming Blackwell Ultra chips are expected to provide data centers 50 times more revenues than its Hopper systems buoyed by its superfast AI servicing capabilities to multiple users.
Excellent Estimate Revisions for NVDA Stock
NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 52.1% and 47.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% in the last 30 days.
It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 22.7% and 24.4%, respectively, for next year (ending January 2027). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.4% in the last 30 days.
Lucrative Valuation of NVDA Shares
NVIDIA has a return on equity (ROE) of 112.3% compared with the S&P 500’s ROE of 17.1% and the industry’s ROE of a mere 6.4%. It has a forward P/E (price/earnings) of 21.9% compared with the industry’s P/E of 21.9% and the S&P 500’s P/E of 16.5%. The short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 82.9% from the last closing price of $114.33. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $120-$220.
Broadcom
Broadcom has been benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). In fiscal 2024, AI revenues jumped 220% over fiscal 2023 to $12.2 billion and represented 41% of semiconductor revenues.

Chicago, IL – April 11, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA and Apple AAPL.
Apple Retreats to Rare Long-Term Value Zone
Charlie Munger’s Strategy: Buy Quality Stocks at the 200-Week MA
Charlie Munger’s Lessons to Buffett
Warren Buffett is widely regarded as the most prolific and successful value investor of all time in most Wall Street circles. However, Buffett did not achieve success on his own. His best “investment” decision was probably his teaming up with Charles Munger. Munger, who passed away in November 2023 at 99 years old, was Buffet’s best friend and was full of comedic charm, wisdom, experience, and investment knowledge until the day he died.
Did Buffett and Munger Use Technical Analysis?
One of my favorite quotes, especially regarding investing, is“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”Having tried nearly every indicator under the sun and multiple investing strategies over my years of investing, I have learned that successful investing is more about removing clutter and focusing like a laser on what really matters.
While I would label my own personal investing framework as a trend-following growth investor, I would never discount Buffett and Munger’s success, and I discovered an old Munger quote that resonates with me:
“If all you ever did was buy high-quality stocks on the 200-week moving average, you would beat the S&P 500 by a large margin over time.”
The reason the quote resonated with me so strongly is because I have been utilizing this strategy for long-term investments for years, without seeing the quote. Though you and I will never be able to dig into a company balance sheet like Munger and Buffett, we can utilize some of these words of wisdom to make us better investors. While Buffett and Munger are known chiefly for their deep fundamental analysis, the Munger quote suggests that the two investing legends use very long-term technical analysis to their advantage.
Apple Has Held the 200-Week for Two Decades
Up until chip kingNvidiaarguably took the throne recently,Applehad been the “true market leader” for two decades. The stock became so popular with investors that if a hedge fund or mutual fund did not have it on its book, it was looked at as a negative.
Nevertheless, though the stock and company have produced incredible performance, they were still beholden to market forces and gravity. Regardless of how strong a stock is, eventually, its valuation gets too bloated or a market correction occurs (remember, 75% of a stock’s move is attributed to the general market’s direction).
Earlier this week AAPL tagged the 200-week and bounced viciously. Though the stock only touches the moving average once every four or five years, the long-term results are incredible. Even in the depths of the worst financial crisis in a century (The Global Financial Crisis of 2008) the 200-week MA contained AAPL shares.
Apple’s Valuation is Attractive
After the “DeepSeek” and tariff-related correction, Apple’s price-to-book ratio has become much cheaper, dropping from over 65x to ~44x today.
Apple: Addressing Tariffs Concerns
Yesterday, the Trump Administration announced a 90-day pause on its harsh tariffs on the Chinese. This is good news for AAPL obviously, and luckily, we were in before it hit. In addition, investors are likely discounting the fact that many clients bought with fears of higher prices, thus frontloading revenue.
Bottom Line
All stocks eventually succumb to gravity, and Apple is no different. However, yesterday, the stock retreated to a level that has held for more than two decades.

Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of+48.4%, +50.2%and+56.7%per year.

### Current and Forecasted Market Sentiment for Nvidia

#### Current Sentiment Analysis
The current market sentiment for Nvidia is **Neutral**. This assessment is based on a combination of factors, including analyst outlooks, market reactions to trade tensions, and the company's strategic positioning in the AI sector.

1.  **Analyst Adjustments:** Citi adjusted its outlook on Nvidia, reducing projected GPU unit shipments for 2025 and 2026 by 3% and 5%, respectively, due to concerns over hyperscaler capital expenditures and broader economic uncertainty linked to the ongoing trade war [11, 12]. This led to a reduction in Nvidia's earnings projections by 3% for 2025 and 6% for 2026, with a revised price target of $150 [11]. However, Citi maintained a Buy rating on the stock [11, 12, 22].

2.  **Trade War Impact:** The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has introduced volatility in the market, affecting chipmakers [5, 16]. Texas Instruments, with its U.S.-based manufacturing, faced a steeper decline due to potential tariff rates of 84% or higher, while Nvidia, which outsources manufacturing, saw a rise [5, 16, 17]. The China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) exempted U.S. chipmakers that outsource manufacturing from retaliatory tariffs, benefiting Nvidia [16, 17].

3.  **AI Leadership:** Despite short-term concerns, Nvidia remains a leader in the GPU market with over 80% share, giving it a competitive edge [9, 20]. There is strong demand for Nvidia's chips, including the new Blackwell chips, due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces [9, 21]. Nvidia is well-poised to benefit from the increase in AI data center spending, with major cloud computing stocks investing in AI infrastructure [9, 20].

4.  **Valuation and Growth:** Nvidia has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 52.1% and 47.5%, respectively, for the current year [21]. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% in the last 30 days [21]. However, Nvidia's shares have fallen 15.1% this year amid tariff concerns [20].

#### Forecasted Sentiment
The forecasted sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for positive growth driven by AI advancements and strategic partnerships.

1.  **AI-Driven Growth:** Nvidia's commitment to innovation and the development of new chipsets for reasoning AI models are expected to drive future growth [21]. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra chips are anticipated to provide data centers with significantly more revenue than previous systems [21].

2.  **Strategic Investments:** Alphabet has deepened its enterprise partnerships, fueling growth in AI and cloud, and has deployed Nvidia's H200-based platforms to customers [13]. Alphabet was also the first to announce a customer running on the highly anticipated Blackwell platform, reinforcing its strong ties with Nvidia [13].

3.  **Market Rebound:** Despite recent market volatility, analysts expect Nvidia's stock to rebound, with short-term average price targets representing a significant increase from the current price [21].

#### Conclusion
The overall market sentiment for Nvidia is **Neutral**. While concerns over trade tensions and capital spending have led to analyst adjustments and price target reductions, Nvidia's leadership in the AI sector, strong growth prospects, and strategic partnerships provide a balanced outlook. The company's ability to navigate the trade war and capitalize on the increasing demand for AI infrastructure will be crucial in determining its future market performance."""

email_crypto = """<market_analysis_report>: ```### Current and Forecasted Market Sentiment for Ethereum

#### Current Sentiment Analysis
The current market sentiment for Ethereum is **Negative**. This conclusion is drawn from several factors highlighted in the news articles:

1.  **Price Decline and Bearish Momentum**: Ethereum has been experiencing a downtrend, with the price dropping significantly from its peak earlier in the cycle [22]. The asset closed a recent week with a 14% loss, and the price briefly touched $1,400 [16]. This selloff is described as "extremely aggressive" [16]. Ethereum fell 2.2% [8] and 8.79% [27].

2.  **Technical Indicators**: Technical indicators suggest a continued bearish outlook. Ethereum is trading below the 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, which have turned into dynamic resistance zones [22]. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering close to oversold territory, indicating growing selling pressure [22].

3.  **ETF Outflows**: Ethereum funds have experienced redemptions, with iShares’ ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experiencing outflows of $5.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively [28].

4.  **Analyst Concerns**: Some analysts have drawn comparisons between Ethereum and Nokia, suggesting that Ethereum could be headed for a slow decline due to its aging architecture and scalability limitations [15]. One analyst, Crypto Curb, noted that Ethereum's market cap has declined from over 20% of the total crypto market cap to less than 10% [15].

5.  **Whale Activity**: A previously dormant ETH whale dumped 10,702 ETH after nearly two years of inactivity, signaling weakening conviction among large investors [17].

#### Forecasted Sentiment
Despite the current negative sentiment, there are indications of potential recovery and positive developments in the future:

1.  **Potential Rebound**: Some analysts suggest that Ethereum may soon witness a relief rally, as it nears a key demand zone that has historically marked market bottoms [17]. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is likely approaching the -1 standard deviation pricing band based on Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, which has historically marked market bottoms [17].

2.  **Vitalik Buterin's Privacy Roadmap**: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a comprehensive roadmap to enhance user privacy on the blockchain [5, 11, 13, 14, 18]. This plan aims to make private transactions and anonymous on-chain interactions more accessible, which could drive greater adoption as the network evolves [13].

3.  **Hong Kong Approval for Staking Services**: HashKey received approval from Hong Kong regulators to offer crypto staking services, potentially broadening the institutional appeal of proof-of-stake investments such as spot Ether ETFs [26]. This could lead to investors holding Ether ETFs to obtain staking income [26].

4.  **Potential for Staking in US ETFs**: There is growing confidence that staking services are coming to US Ether ETFs in the near future, especially with the election of US President Donald Trump and the installation of a pro-crypto SEC Chair [26]. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart suggested that clearance for staking on ETH funds could come as early as May [30].

5.  **Technical Analysis**: Analyst Titan of Crypto noted that Ethereum could be on the verge of a comeback based on the ETH/BTC trading pair, with the RSI showing a familiar pattern that previously signaled a potential shift in momentum [20].

#### Conclusion
In summary, the overall market sentiment for Ethereum is currently **Negative** due to recent price declines, bearish technical indicators, ETF outflows, and concerns about its competitiveness. However, there are signs of a possible long-term recovery driven by potential demand zones, Vitalik Buterin's privacy roadmap, regulatory developments in Hong Kong, and the potential for staking in US ETFs. The immediate outlook remains bearish, but these evolving factors could provide opportunities for future growth.```

    <li><b>Technical Indicators:</b> Technical analysis points to continued bearish momentum. Ethereum is trading below its 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, which are now acting as resistance [22]. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold levels, indicating strong selling pressure [22].</li>
    <li><b>ETF Outflows:</b> Ethereum funds are seeing redemptions. iShares’ ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH experienced outflows of $5.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively [28].</li>
    <li><b>Analyst Concerns:</b> Comparisons to Nokia have been drawn, suggesting Ethereum could face a slow decline due to its architecture and scalability issues [15]. Crypto Curb noted Ethereum's market cap has decreased from over 20% to less than 10% of the total crypto market cap [15].</li>
    <li><b>Whale Activity:</b> A previously inactive ETH whale moved 10,702 ETH after nearly two years, suggesting weakening conviction among large holders [17].</li>
</ul>

<h3>Forecasted Sentiment: Potential for Recovery</h3>

<p>Despite the current negative sentiment, several factors suggest a potential recovery:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Potential Rebound:</b> Ethereum may experience a relief rally as it approaches a key demand zone that has historically marked market bottoms [17]. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum is likely approaching the -1 standard deviation pricing band based on Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, which has historically marked market bottoms [17].</li>
    <li><b>Vitalik Buterin's Privacy Roadmap:</b> Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a roadmap to enhance user privacy on the blockchain [5, 11, 13, 14, 18]. This aims to make private transactions and anonymous on-chain interactions more accessible, potentially driving adoption [13].</li>
    <li><b>Hong Kong Approval for Staking Services:</b> HashKey has received approval in Hong Kong to offer crypto staking services, potentially increasing the appeal of proof-of-stake investments like spot Ether ETFs [26]. This could encourage investors to hold Ether ETFs for staking income [26].</li>
    <li><b>Potential for Staking in US ETFs:</b> There is growing confidence that staking services are coming to US Ether ETFs, especially with the election of US President Donald Trump and the installation of a pro-crypto SEC Chair [26]. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart suggested that clearance for staking on ETH funds could come as early as May [30].</li>
    <li><b>Technical Analysis:</b> Analyst Titan of Crypto noted that Ethereum could be on the verge of a comeback based on the ETH/BTC trading pair, with the RSI showing a familiar pattern that previously signaled a potential shift in momentum [20].</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The current market sentiment for Ethereum is <b>Negative</b>, influenced by price declines, bearish technical indicators, ETF outflows, and concerns about its competitiveness. However, potential demand zones, Vitalik Buterin's privacy roadmap, regulatory developments in Hong Kong, and the potential for staking in US ETFs offer hope for a long-term recovery. While the immediate outlook remains bearish, these evolving factors could provide opportunities for future growth.</p>

#### Current Sentiment Analysis
The current market sentiment for Nvidia is **Neutral**. This assessment is based on a combination of factors, including analyst outlooks, market reactions to trade tensions, and the company's strategic positioning in the AI sector.

1.  **Analyst Adjustments:** Citi adjusted its outlook on Nvidia, reducing projected GPU unit shipments for 2025 and 2026 by 3% and 5%, respectively, due to concerns over hyperscaler capital expenditures and broader economic uncertainty linked to the ongoing trade war [11, 12]. This led to a reduction in Nvidia's earnings projections by 3% for 2025 and 6% for 2026, with a revised price target of $150 [11]. However, Citi maintained a Buy rating on the stock [11, 12, 22].

2.  **Trade War Impact:** The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has introduced volatility in the market, affecting chipmakers [5, 16]. Texas Instruments, with its U.S.-based manufacturing, faced a steeper decline due to potential tariff rates of 84% or higher, while Nvidia, which outsources manufacturing, saw a rise [5, 16, 17]. The China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) exempted U.S. chipmakers that outsource manufacturing from retaliatory tariffs, benefiting Nvidia [16, 17].

3.  **AI Leadership:** Despite short-term concerns, Nvidia remains a leader in the GPU market with over 80% share, giving it a competitive edge [9, 20]. There is strong demand for Nvidia's chips, including the new Blackwell chips, due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces [9, 21]. Nvidia is well-poised to benefit from the increase in AI data center spending, with major cloud computing stocks investing in AI infrastructure [9, 20].

4.  **Valuation and Growth:** Nvidia has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 52.1% and 47.5%, respectively, for the current year [21]. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% in the last 30 days [21]. However, Nvidia's shares have fallen 15.1% this year amid tariff concerns [20].

#### Forecasted Sentiment
The forecasted sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with potential for positive growth driven by AI advancements and strategic partnerships.

1.  **AI-Driven Growth:** Nvidia's commitment to innovation and the development of new chipsets for reasoning AI models are expected to drive future growth [21]. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra chips are anticipated to provide data centers with significantly more revenue than previous systems [21].

2.  **Strategic Investments:** Alphabet has deepened its enterprise partnerships, fueling growth in AI and cloud, and has deployed Nvidia's H200-based platforms to customers [13]. Alphabet was also the first to announce a customer running on the highly anticipated Blackwell platform, reinforcing its strong ties with Nvidia [13].

3.  **Market Rebound:** Despite recent market volatility, analysts expect Nvidia's stock to rebound, with short-term average price targets representing a significant increase from the current price [21].

#### Conclusion
The overall market sentiment for Nvidia is **Neutral**. While concerns over trade tensions and capital spending have led to analyst adjustments and price target reductions, Nvidia's leadership in the AI sector, strong growth prospects, and strategic partnerships provide a balanced outlook. The company's ability to navigate the trade war and capitalize on the increasing demand for AI infrastructure will be crucial in determining its future market performance.```
